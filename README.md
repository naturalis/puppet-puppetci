puppet-ci
=========

Puppet CI module

It depends on the puppet-jenkins module from rtyler   / matthewbarr on github.  

(it's also in the forge, but is currently fairly far behind the github version.)

For now, it needs manual editing, you can do this via the Jenkins GUI.  You'll need to set the Repo's on the Main settings,
and the URL for the github project in the job configuration.
